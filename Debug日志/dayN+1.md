Shit, Maybe I do feel headache when i'm stressed.


it's pretty painful actually, miserable

What's the point anyway.

Things goes better, I don't feel like a god anymore, I didn't feel much pain as before. 

So, Why am I so fucking painful.

Stressed? No, I'm not really fucking stressful.

All right, maybe a little bit depressed.

I can barely control myself thinking to much. It's like the whole damn world is fake and wrong, but way? what the purpose? 

I always believe that everything has a purpose, like people get pleasure from sex is because of the DNA, people wants money because they think it's the way to be happy.

I don't know, I'm a really terrible writer (especially in English).

So Here is the question what's the point of the universe.

What's the point of reproduction? 

Are we being manipulated for the whole time? 

Is alien real? 

Are we living in the matrix?
