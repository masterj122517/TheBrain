## Modern Zen poem 
To follow the path: 
look to the master 
follow to the master 
walk with the master
see through the master 
become the master

## The World is full of fascinating problems waiting to be solved

### No problem should ever have to be solved twice 

### Boredom and drudgery are evil 

### Freedom is good

### Attitude is no substitute for competence
