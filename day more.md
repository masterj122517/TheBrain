dude,you really got me, when i do the autograd thing, i even write the code before andrej did, when i understand how things work, i write the code and let it work, if im not understanding correctly or my code doesn't work,i would use any method to make myself understand. and i love that, 还有一个我发现的就是，我之所以可以这么engaging在andrej的autograd课程上，一个最重要的原因是我不在乎using this to prove that im a good programmer or im smart,i just want to know all these stuff you know,but when i finished, i kind use makemore or CI as a way to make me feel smart of make me feel like im a good programmer,that why i think all these kind of job boring,they are not boring themself,is my goal makes me feel boring, i hate to prove anything,all i want is just for fun
